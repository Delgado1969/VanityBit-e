# VanityBit-e
You can generate Bitcoin addresses starting with any character. The private key (WIF) of the generated Bitcoin address will also be output.
## Note
1. Python3 must be installed before running.
2. Bitcoin addresses starting with arbitrary characters are generated using brute force, which may place a load on your PC. Also, the speed of generating Bitcoin addresses depends on the specs of your machine.
3. We are not responsible for any loss or liability resulting from the use of this.
